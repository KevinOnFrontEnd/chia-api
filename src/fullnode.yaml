  description: "The Chia node and services come with a JSON RPC API server that allows you to access information and control the services. These are accessible via HTTP, WebSockets, or via client SDKs. The ports can be configured in ~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml. The RPC ports should not be exposed to the internet. TLS certificates are used to secure the communication."
