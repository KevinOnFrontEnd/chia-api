  type: object
  description: >-
    `PoolState` is a type that is serialized to the blockchain to track the state of the user's pool singleton
    `target_puzzle_hash` is either the pool address, or the self-pooling address that pool rewards will be paid to.
    `target_puzzle_hash` is NOT the p2_singleton puzzle that block rewards are sent to.
    The `p2_singleton` address is the initial address, and the `target_puzzle_hash` is the final destination.
    `relative_lock_height` is zero when in SELF_POOLING state
