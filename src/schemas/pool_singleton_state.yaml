    "From the user's point of view, a pool group can be in these states:
      `1 SELF_POOLING`: The singleton exists on the blockchain, and we are farming
          block rewards to a wallet address controlled by the user
      `2 LEAVING_POOL`: The singleton exists, and we have entered the "escaping" state, which
          means we are waiting for a number of blocks = `relative_lock_height` to pass, so we can leave.
      `3 FARMING_TO_POOL`: The singleton exists, and it is assigned to a pool.
      `CLAIMING_SELF_POOLED_REWARDS`: We have submitted a transaction to sweep our
          self-pooled funds."

    - 1 # SELF_POOLING
